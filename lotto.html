                <li>This year's concert tickets to Bruin Bash will be distributed via an online lottery only to current undergraduate UCLA students with a valid BruinCard.</li>
                <li>Please be aware that the performers for Bruin Bash will not be released until a later date.</li>
                <li>A lottery will open on 07/22 solely for floor seating for Pauley Pavilion. Please note these will be standing seats, and no chairs will be provided to students in this section. To enter, students must enter the lottery by 11:59pm on 08/05 at the following link: LINK</li>
                <li>Recipients will be chosen on a random basis.</li>
                <li>Students that do not receive floor seats from the lottery will be informed via email on 08/06, and will automatically be entered into the lottery for 100 and 200 level seating. Please refer to this map [hyperlinked] for reference regarding seating in Pauley Pavilion.</li>
                <li>Students that do receive floor seats from the lottery will receive an email on 08/06, from which they can reject the ticket and be re-entered into the general lottery for 100 and 200 level seating.  The ticket must be rejected by 08/13.</li>
                <li>If the student would like to accept the ticket, then no further action will be required until the day of Bruin Bash to claim the wristband.</li>
                <li>Note that rejecting the floor ticket and re-entering into the lottery does not guarantee a ticket.</li>
                <li>We emphasize that due to the capacity of the venue, not every student will be guaranteed a ticket. We ask that you only enter the lottery if you have genuine interest in attending the event. If you do not receive a ticket to the concert, there are still many other aspects of Bruin Bash that may be enjoyed, including the festival and free film, with more info to come at bruinbash.ucla.edu</li>
