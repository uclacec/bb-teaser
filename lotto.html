                <li>This year's concert tickets to Bruin Bash will be distributed via an online lottery only to current undergraduate UCLA students with a valid BruinCard. </li>
                <li>Please be aware that the performers for Bruin Bash will not be released until a later date, after the lottery closes.</li>
                <li>A lottery will open on 08/05 at 12am for both floor and 100/200 level seating for Pauley Pavilion. </li>
                <li>Please note the floor will be standing, and no chairs will be provided to students in this section. 100 level seating refers to the lower stands, while 200 level seating refers to the upper stands.</li>
                <li>To enter, students must enter a lottery by 4pm on 09/07 using a link that will be available at the following link: <a href="https://oss.ticketmaster.com/aps/uclacto/EN/link/buy/details/m162832">CLICK HERE</a></li>
                <li>Students may choose to enter the floor lottery OR the 100/200 level seating lottery.</li>
                <li>There is only one lottery for both the 100 and 200 seating levels. On the day of Bruin Bash, students that received a ticket from the lottery will have the opportunity to claim a wristband for either the 100 seating level or the 200 seating level, based on a first-come-first-served basis.</li>
                <li>Recipients will be chosen on a random basis.</li>
                <li>Students that do not receive floor seats from the lottery will be informed via email on 09/07, and will automatically be entered into the lottery for 100/200 level seating. </li>
                <li>Students that do receive floor seats from the lottery will receive an email on 09/07, from which they can reject the ticket and be re-entered into the general lottery for 100/200 level seating.  The ticket must be rejected by 09/09 before 4pm; otherwise, the floor ticket will be bound to the student’s BruinCard and cannot be exchanged.</li>
                <li>If the student would like to accept the floor ticket, then no further action will be required until the day of Bruin Bash to claim the wristband.</li>
                <li>Note that rejecting the floor ticket and re-entering into the 100/200 lottery does not guarantee a ticket.</li>
                <li>Students entered in the 100/200 level seating lottery will be informed on 09/12 via email if they received a ticket or not.</li>
                <li>We emphasize that due to the capacity of the venue, not every student will be guaranteed a ticket. We ask that you only enter the lottery if you have genuine interest in attending the event. If you do not receive a ticket to the concert, there are still many other aspects of Bruin Bash that may be enjoyed, including the festival and free film, with more info to come at bruinbash.ucla.edu</li>
                <li>We ask that if you would like special accommodations regarding participation in the concert, please contact the Center for Accessible Education, formerly known as the Office for Students with Disabilities, at emccloskey@saonet.ucla.edu or (310) 825-1501 between the dates of 08/15 - 08/31 prior to signing up for the lottery.
